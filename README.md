# Dice App

## Introduction

The Dice App is an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience developed using Unity and the PolySpatial tools, based on the VisionOS template. It introduces an interactive platform with a virtual dice into your physical space. Users can pick up, throw the dice, and dynamically receive the value of the dice roll, enhancing the traditional dice-rolling experience with the magic of AR.
